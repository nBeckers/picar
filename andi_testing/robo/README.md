Garden WeedBot Pipeline
=======================

Proof-of-concept image-processing pipeline for a hypothetical garden robot that:

1. Cruises through a garden and captures RGB images of plants.
2. Detects individual plants / weeds in those images.
3. Classifies each detected object as *plant* (keep), *weed* (remove), or *unsure* (store for later human review).

The repository only covers the *software* side â€“ hardware integration (motors, cameras, weed-pulling arm, etc.) is out of scope for this demo.

Quick start
-----------

1.  Install the few required Python packages (ideally in a venv):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2.  Place raw garden photos in the `images/` folder (some demo pictures are already included).

3.  Run the pipeline:

```bash
python -m garden_weedbot --input images --output output --conf 0.6
```

After finishing, youâ€™ll have:

```
output/
  plant/      # confidently classified as crop
  weed/       # confidently classified as weed
  unsure/     # low-confidence crops for manual labelling
```

How does it work?
-----------------

The main goal is to keep the demo fully self-contained: no large model downloads, no GPU, and no need for a labelled dataset.  Instead, we use a *very* naive heuristic classifier that looks at the colour distribution inside each detected object:

* *Greenish* crops â†’ likely a **plant** (good crop)
* *Brownish* or *yellowish* crops â†’ likely a **weed** (remove)

Confidence is proportional to how strongly the colour histogram leans towards one side.  The `conf` CLI flag controls the threshold at which we trust the prediction â€“ below that we save the image in `output/unsure/` for a human to verify.

Limitations
-----------

* The colour-based heuristic obviously fails in many real-world scenarios.  It is merely a placeholder so the rest of the pipeline (detection, cropping, I/O) can be exercised without a trained ML model.
* Detection is done by simple HSV thresholding + connected-component analysis.  This is far from state-of-the-art but is completely deterministic, fast and dependency-free.

Next steps
----------

In a real product you would replace `garden_weedbot/simple_classifier.py` with a trained CNN or transformer model, possibly fine-tuned on a dataset collected by running this very pipeline (thanks to the `unsure` folder).
